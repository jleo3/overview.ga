  Being able to build things quickly means getting it in front of your audience quickly
  - try things out
  - quickly find out what works and what doesn't
  - pivot, iterate fast

  Be Test Driven - don't just think your code works, _prove_ that it works

##Keys to Rails Success

* Fail Fast / Succeed Faster
* Be More Agile (??)
* Make Testing the Norm
