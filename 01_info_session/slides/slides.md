#Why Rails?

##GitHub

<aside class="notes">
 - At about the same time, actually in 2007, Heroku was formed
 - James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry
 - Heroku's first job was to host Ruby on Rails applications
 - take DHH's demo and put it on the World Wide Web easier than ever
 - same as GitHub and Rails, they make things faster, easier, more accessible
 - Build an app in 15 minutes, host it in minutes!
 - (DEMO)

<aside class="notes">
  Being able to build things quickly means getting it in front of your audience quickly
  - try things out
  - quickly find out what works and what doesn't
  - pivot, iterate fast

  Be Test Driven - don't just think your code works, _prove_ that it works
