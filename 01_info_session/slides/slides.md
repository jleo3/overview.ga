#Why Rails?

<aside class="notes">
  While building Basecamp for 37Signals, DHH spotted an opportunity to extract a web development framework for Ruby. He did this in 2004 and made the source code available to the public in 2005.

  -- Available on YouTube - interesting history lesson
  -- Everyone goes bananas - fast, sleek, uses this great looking language - Ruby
  -- Accolades to follow, including Hacker of the Year honors from Google, O'Reilly

##DEMO
* "Look at all the things I'm _not_ doing!"
* "Look at all the configuration I'm _not_ writing!"
* "It just uses ruby EVERYWHERE."

  - David went on to show testing, and making the blog better looking
  - but lots of scaffolding, much of directory structure, even some help files remain
  - Twitter Bootstrap, Rails Composer can get you up and running in style

<aside class="notes">
  - DHH didn't have GitHub in 2005. That came along in 2008. 
  - Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner
  - A tool that helps ppl collaborate in previously unheard-of ways
  - Build an app in 15 minutes, share it in minutes!

##GitHub

<aside class="notes">
 - At about the same time, actually in 2007, Heroku was formed
 - James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry
 - Heroku's first job was to host Ruby on Rails applications
 - Bought for 212mm, started with RoR 
 - take DHH's demo and put it on the World Wide Web easier than ever
 - same as GitHub and Rails, they make things faster, easier, more accessible
 - Build an app in 15 minutes, host it in minutes!
 - (DEMO)

<aside class="notes">
  Being able to build things quickly means getting it in front of your audience quickly
  - try things out
  - quickly find out what works and what doesn't
  - pivot, iterate fast
  - the reason there are so many startups, and ppl fund what's basically just an idea 
  - developers, using these tools, can go from idea to working application in a snap
